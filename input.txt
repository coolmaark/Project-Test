I see people doing these daily prompts and I thought I would maybe do one or two when I felt like it – who knows it might even be a new obsession.

This was the question posed today – what is my ideal home?

When I think of this I think of something small, warm, cosy out in the middle of nowhere. A place for serenity and reflection and to look out and see the world as it should be. It would be a place of creativity and inspiration.

It’s a nice dream and maybe one day, I have to hope or it’ll never happen.
